## API testing
This is a api testing site like Postman, in fact I created this base on postman, it allows you to use GET POST PUT DELETE to a url just like Postman.

## How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
- Make sure you have CORS solved or set up a proxy
